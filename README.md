# CS-303-Assign-2

This one is straightforward as there was no user input this time.

The main function creates an empty stack.
Then it checks to see if the stack is empty. After returning that it is, it pushes some values to the stack. 
Then it returns the top of the stack before removing that entry. 
Then it returns the average of the int of the remaining entries which is 2.5.
